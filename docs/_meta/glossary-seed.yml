# Architecture Terms
RLS: Row Level Security - PostgreSQL feature that restricts data access at the row level based on user context
Edge Function: Serverless function deployed on Supabase's edge network for low-latency API endpoints
Multi-tenant: Architecture where a single application instance serves multiple isolated organizations
JWT: JSON Web Token - compact, URL-safe token format used for authentication and authorization
Service Role Key: Privileged API key that bypasses RLS policies, used only in server-side contexts
Anon Key: Public API key with restricted access, safe for client-side use

# Product Terms
Unit: A refrigeration unit (cooler, freezer, walk-in) being monitored for temperature compliance
Site: A physical location containing one or more units under an organization
Excursion: A temperature reading outside the configured safe range for a unit
Alert Rule: Configuration defining temperature thresholds and timing for generating alerts
Check-in Interval: The configured frequency at which a sensor should report temperature readings
Confirm Time: Delay before a temperature excursion triggers an active alarm (prevents false positives)

# IoT Hardware Terms
LoRa: Long Range - low-power wireless protocol for IoT sensor communication
TTN: The Things Network - community and enterprise LoRaWAN network infrastructure
DevEUI: Device Extended Unique Identifier - globally unique 64-bit identifier for LoRa devices
Gateway: LoRaWAN gateway that receives sensor transmissions and forwards to TTN
Join Request: LoRaWAN procedure where a device authenticates and joins the network
Uplink: Data transmission from sensor to network (readings, status)
Downlink: Data transmission from network to sensor (configuration, commands)

# Alert System Terms
Escalation: Process of notifying additional contacts when an alert is not acknowledged
Notification Policy: Configuration for how and when to send alert notifications
Quiet Hours: Time periods when non-critical notifications are suppressed
MTTR: Mean Time To Resolution - average time from alert creation to resolution

# Monitoring Terms
Health Check: Automated system status verification across all components
Degraded: System state where functionality is impaired but not completely failed
Debug Terminal: Developer tool displaying real-time application logs and events
Event Log: Timestamped record of system and business events for auditing

# Security Terms
RBAC: Role-Based Access Control - permission system based on user roles within organizations
Organization Context: The tenant boundary that determines data access scope
Session Token: Time-limited authentication credential stored after user login
MFA: Multi-Factor Authentication - requiring multiple verification methods for login

# Data Terms
Sensor Reading: Individual temperature measurement with timestamp and metadata
Reading Buffer: Temporary storage for sensor readings before database persistence
Soft Delete: Marking records as deleted without physical removal (preserves audit trail)
Cascade: Automatic propagation of database operations to related records

# Integration Terms
Webhook: HTTP callback triggered by external events (TTN data, Stripe payments, Telnyx delivery status)
API Endpoint: URL path that accepts requests and returns responses
Idempotency: Property where repeated operations produce the same result
Rate Limiting: Restricting the number of requests within a time window
Messaging Profile: Telnyx configuration grouping phone numbers, webhooks, and message settings under a named profile
Toll-Free Verification: Regulatory process requiring business verification before sending SMS from toll-free numbers
Ed25519 Signature: Cryptographic signature algorithm used by Telnyx to verify webhook authenticity
Opt-In Asset: Image or document proving customer consent for SMS communications

# Development Terms
Supabase: Backend-as-a-service platform providing PostgreSQL, Auth, and Edge Functions
Vite: Modern frontend build tool for development and production bundling
React Query: Data fetching and caching library for React applications
Zustand: Lightweight state management library for React
