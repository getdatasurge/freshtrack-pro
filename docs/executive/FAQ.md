## General Questions

### What exactly is FreshTrack Pro?

FreshTrack Pro is a cloud-based system that automatically monitors temperatures in commercial refrigerators, freezers, and cold storage. It uses wireless sensors to track conditions 24/7, sends alerts when problems occur, and maintains complete records for compliance purposes.

### Who is FreshTrack Pro designed for?

FreshTrack Pro is built for any organization that needs to maintain strict temperature control:
- Restaurants and food service operations
- Grocery stores and supermarkets
- Healthcare facilities (vaccine storage, blood banks)
- Food manufacturing and distribution
- Hotels and hospitality
- Schools and universities

### How is this different from a simple thermometer?

A thermometer tells you the temperature right now. FreshTrack Pro:
- Monitors **continuously** (every 5 minutes, 24/7)
- **Alerts you immediately** when something goes wrong
- **Keeps permanent records** of all readings
- **Escalates** to managers if staff don't respond
- **Generates reports** for compliance and inspections

## Security & Data Protection

### Is our data secure?

Yes. FreshTrack Pro employs enterprise-grade security:

| Security Measure | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Encryption** | All data encrypted in transit and at rest |
| **Access Control** | Role-based permissions — users only see what they need |
| **Cloud Infrastructure** | Hosted on enterprise-grade cloud platforms |
| **Compliance** | Designed to meet HACCP, FDA, and industry standards |
| **Audit Logging** | All access and changes are logged |

### Who can see our data?

Only people you authorize. FreshTrack Pro uses role-based access:
- **Owners/Admins** — Full access to all data and settings
- **Managers** — Access to their locations and reports
- **Staff** — Access to log temperatures and acknowledge alerts

No one outside your organization can see your data.

### Where is our data stored?

Data is stored in secure cloud infrastructure with:
- Automatic backups
- Geographic redundancy
- 99.9%+ uptime guarantee

### Can data be deleted?

For compliance reasons, temperature data and audit logs are retained permanently and cannot be deleted. This ensures complete records for inspections and liability protection.

## Reliability & Uptime

### What happens if the internet goes down?

**Sensors continue to work.** They store readings locally and sync when connectivity returns.

**Manual logging works offline.** Staff can log temperatures on their phones even without internet — data syncs automatically when connection is restored.

**You'll know about outages.** The system alerts you if a sensor stops communicating, so you can investigate.

### What is your uptime guarantee?

FreshTrack Pro is designed for 99.9%+ availability. Our cloud infrastructure is:
- Distributed across multiple data centers
- Automatically monitored 24/7
- Designed with no single point of failure

### What if a sensor fails?

Sensors are designed for years of reliable operation, but if one fails:
- You'll receive a "sensor offline" alert
- Manual logging can cover the gap
- Replacement sensors are available for quick swap

## Technical Questions (Non-Technical Answers)

### How do the sensors communicate?

Sensors use **LoRa wireless technology** — a long-range, low-power radio signal designed for sensors. Benefits:
- Works through walls and across large facilities
- Battery life of 2+ years
- No need for WiFi in each refrigerator

### Do sensors need WiFi?

The sensors themselves don't use WiFi. They communicate with a small gateway device that does need an internet connection. One gateway typically covers an entire location.

### Can this work with our existing thermometers?

FreshTrack Pro uses its own sensors for automated monitoring. However:
- Staff can log readings from any thermometer manually
- Existing sensors can sometimes be integrated (ask sales)

### Does it work with our POS or inventory system?

Standard FreshTrack Pro operates independently. Enterprise customers can discuss integration options with our team.
